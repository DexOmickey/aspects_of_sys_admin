Tracerouting to this IP address is quite interesting. For starters the IP is device or node on the Stevens network. Using the Visual Traceroute tool, the route starts from 83.136.252.1 which is in the United Kingdom. You would think it should traverse straight through the fiber lines in the ocean but make it makes a strange decision to route next the net.upcloud.com(94.237.0.46) AS in Finland which next routes back to the west an AS in Germany named link.telia.net (62.115.112.122) before routing itself through the ocean to Newark New Jersey(130.156.34.246) getting itself to stevens network. Traceroute actually went through 13 hops and it can also be identified that the traceroute went through 3 different Ases from source to destination i.e.(net.upcloud.com,link.telia.net and New Jersey Higher Education Network). In all the traceroute completed in 79.152ms, i can only imagine that the delay would have been less if it traversed over the ocean from UK than going to Finland before coming back to the west. But it was probably the best route or shortest the routing algorithm can identify.
The traceroute on map tool also yielded different results. Starting from Germany(136.243.241.1) it moved to through to a telia.net AS (62.115.183.232) in Finland which moves to Switzerland then finally traverses itself through the ocean to New Jersey. The traceroute used less hops than that of the Visual Traceroute tool, going through 3 ASes as well i.e.(.hetzner.com, .telia.net and New Jersey Higher Education Network). Despite the less hops its delay was 99.144ms which is greater than the previous tool. I can only assume the second tool experienced some sort of queuing or transmission delay as compared to the first tool because their propagation delay looks fairly equal.
Tracerouting from my pc to 155.246.56.11 takes less time and hops because my ISP is found on the same continent and the 155.246.56.11 is found, which does not need to traverse through multiple Ases.



-Tracerouting to 206.195.187.229
The IP 206.195.187.229 is owned by the City and County of Honolulu which is found in Hawaii. Using the Visual Traceroute tool, the traceroute starts from 83.136.252.1 Stevenage in the UK. Again, there is a weird hop which moves eastward of the destination of the traceroute to Finland once again to the net.upcloud.com (94.237.0.120) AS. Then it makes a strange back to the United Kingdom again through 212.187.165.105 in London which then propagates itself a long way through the fiber links in the ocean to the United States to Colorado which moves through an IXP(212.187.165.105) through the Tier1 operator Level3.net AS (4.69.220.26) with a massive propagation delay of 88.3ms before getting to Colorado. From the Level3.net AS it moves to the tbone.rr.com(66.109.6.41) in Kansas before getting to its destination in Hawaii. The Traceroute completed going through 13 hops and going through 3 ASes (net.upcloud.com, Level3.net(Tier1 Operator) and tbone.rr.com) which got completed under 158ms. It is worth noting the significant delay while the route traversed from Europe it could be that there was high propagation delay where the distance was rationally greater than the speed of then link, Other factors could also play here.
Using the traceroute on map tool, the traceroute is completed within 12 hops starting Germany, moving from the hetzner.com (213.239.229.53) AS and makes a dashing trip to Ireland through the ip4.gtt.net (77.67.76.141,213.200.124.182,208.116.213.118) which finally makes its way to the US through the ocean fiber links straight to California through the rr.com AS, from there makes its way to Hawaii. The traceroute made its way through 3 ASes (hetzner.com, gtt.net,rr.com) and it went through all its hop within  193.160ms which is some significant delay. But it can induced based the initial results from the Visual Traceroute tool and that of the traceroute on map tool that the massive delay is due to the difference in distance between the source and destination which is rational greater than the speed of the links.Hence propagation delay was a major factor here.
Running the traceroute from my pc did not yield much difference from that of the previous tests. There was high propagation delay as expected, it also routed through the rr.com AS to get Hawaii but used a different AS from the beginning because of the source of the traceroute.


 
-Tracerouting to 190.64.134.53
Targeting the CLIENTE ANTEL URUGUAY (190.64.134.53) in Uruguay the traceroute goes through multiple hops to get to its destination. Using the Visual Traceroute tool, as usual the route starts from London in the United Kingdom at 83.136.252.1 and quickly darts itself to Brighton in the UK (149.11.141.9) which a part of the Tier1 Operator atlas.cogentco.com. The route then traverses from Europe to the America using the same AS to Kansas which darts to Philadelphia on the same AS (66.28.4.197).From Philadelphia it moves back to Kansas and makes it way to Washington State (38.88.165.178) which routes itself through an IXP (38.88.165.178) to the antel.net.uy AS (179.31.62.5) straight to the destination in Montevideo, Uruguary .The traceroute took 19 hoops to complete going through the atlas.cogentco.com , antel.net.uy and adinet.com.uy ASes, which 
took about 239.983ms which understandable considering the distance between the source and destination as well as the route it took.
Using the traceroute on map tool, the traceroute begins from Germany 136.243.241.1 which moves the AS hetzner.com(213.239.229.53) then through the Tier 1 operator eth.zayo.com within Europe before making the journey across Europe to the US in New York (64.125.29.17). Within the same AS it makes its way from New York to Colorado (64.125.46.121) which goes through an IXP(64.125.46.121) to the antel.net.uy AS and make it way to the destination in Montevideo. The traceroute completes in 22 hops in 250.8ms, going through 3 distinct Ases (hetzner.com,eth.zayo.com(Tier1 Operator) and antel.net.uy). Just link the previous traceroute with Visual Traceroute distance is key to the delay, though there may be marginal factors of Queueing, Nodal and transmission delays, propagation delay plays a major here to complete this traceroute. 
Running the traceroute from my pc differed in delay of 183ms going through 19 hops as well using atlas.cogentco.com ,antel.net.uy and adinet.com.uy like the other traceroutes did.



-Tracerouting to 196.10.52.57
This is a traceroute to AFRINIC in Johannesburg South Africa. First using Visual Traceroute tool, as usual starts its route from the United Kingdom (83.136.252.1) which makes its way to find the isnet.net AS which makes its way through that same AS over Europe to North Africa straight down towards South Africa to inx.net.za(196.10.52.57) its destination. The traceroute was fairly short using just 9 hops and 1 AS to get to its destination within 166.286ms.
Using the traceroute on map tool, the traceroute begins from Germany (136.243.241.1) which traverses to join the hetzner.com AS from Germany at 213.239.229.49 and finds its way to the isnet.net AS which moves straight to down South Africa to the destination ntp1.inx.net.za. The traceroute goes through two ASes in hetzner.com and isnet.net in 9 hops as well completed within 195.832ms . The distance between source and destination does not look lengthy as compared to the previous tests which you would expect the delay to be less compared to the previous ones. However, it was not so I can only assume the delay was cause low bandwidth in the link of the isnet.net AS 
Using my pc produces more hops than the previous traceroutes because the source is not as close to the destination as previous sources are. This time it uses 14 hops to get to the destination, going through 4 ASes i.e. lightpath.net, cv.net,.atlas.cogentco.com and then finally isnet.net, and this was completed within 251ms which is understandable because of the routes it took.  



-Tracerouting to 144.48.166.166
This traceroute is to TSGNLCO-AU in Australia. Using Visual Traceroute tool, as usual starts routing from the United Kingdom (83.136.252.1) which makes an instant jump over the ocean to California in the United States the he.net AS starting from 195.66.224.21 to 184.105.222.86. It then traverses from California straight to Australia to the megaport.com AS (103.26.71.46) which finds its way to the destination cosima.470n.act.tsgnl.co (144.48.166.166). The traceroute goes through 10 hops, 2 ASes which completes within 269.544ms. For a destination kind of far from its source you expect it to go through a lot of hops however it didnâ€™t.
Using the traceroute on map tool, the traceroute begins from Germany 136.243.241.1, the route then moves  through the AS fsn1.hetzner.com (213.239.229.53) which moves straight over to the he.net AS in California and makes its way to its destination in Australia cosima.470n.act.tsgnl.co (144.48.166.166). The traceroute goes through 8 hops in 271.152ms and going through 3 ASes.
Tracerouting from my pc yielded strange results: more hops than of the previous two. You would think since the routes going to Australia  goes through US, you would expect there to be less hops but in this case there were 18 hops going through 3 ASes(lightpath.net, cogentco.com and gslnetworks.com.au) before getting to the destination cosima.470n.act.tsgnl.co [144.48.166.166] in 293ms


   
-Tracerouting to 144.76.76.107
This traceroute makes a short trip to the Germany HETZNER-fsn1-dc10.Using Visual Traceroute tool, the route starts from the United Kingdom(83.136.252.1) which then moves to Finland through the net.upcloud.com AS (94.237.0.48) and traverses back to Germany through hetzner.de(80.81.193.164) and hetzner.com(213.239.229.62) before getting to its destination sv1.ggsrv.de (144.76.76.107). The trace goes through 8 hops and 3 ASes before getting to its destination in 20.791ms.
Using the traceroute on map tool, operating in Germany as you would expect should take less time and hops to get to the destination. As expected the trace goes through 2 hops, through the  ex9k2.dc10.fsn1.hetzner.com AS (213.239.229.62)  and then the destination sv1.ggsrv.de (144.76.76.107) which takes 0.229ms
From my pc routing from the USA should take more hops and time. It does take 11 hops going through 4 ASes (lightpath.net, cv.net, core-backbone.com and hetzner.com) before getting to the destination in 93ms



-Tracerouting to 211.233.84.186
This trace is to LG DACOM KIDC in Seoul, South Korea. Using Visual Traceroute tool, the route starts from (83.136.252.1) in the United Kingdom which join the net.upcloud.com AS all the way in Finland (94.237.0.120). Trace then traverses back to UK, then travels the distance over ocean to Kansas in the US through the Tier 1 Operator Level3.net(4.69.209.157) and finally makes a long trip from San Jose to its destination in Seoul South Korea dadns.cdnetworks.co.kr (211.233.84.186). The trace takes 278.238ms to complete going through 15 hops and 2 identified ASes (net.upcloud.com ,Level3.net)
Using the traceroute on map tool, the trace starts from Germany (136.243.241.1) the source, which moves through the AS hetzner.com (213.239.229.49). Going through that AS in Germany it move to the core-backbone.com AS (5.56.20.253) then darting to the Level3.net AS (4.69.209.157) before making the long trip from Europe to dadns.cdnetworks.co.kr (211.233.84.186) in Seoul South Korea. The trace goes through 16 hops which has 3 Ases (hetzner.com,core-backbone.com,Level3.net) in 274.803ms.
Initiating the trace from my pc yields a very different path and number of hops basically because of the distance between source and destination. The trace goes through 22 hops going through 3 Ases i.e. cv.net, lightpath.net, cogentco.com before getting to its destination in Seoul which took 578ms.
